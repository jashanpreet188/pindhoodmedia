# 🚀 Vercel Deployment - Quick Fix Guide

## ✅ **ISSUE FIXED: Output Directory Configuration**

The "No Output Directory named 'build' found" error has been resolved! Here's what was fixed:

### **Updated `vercel.json`:**
```json
{
  "outputDirectory": "dist",        // ← This tells Vercel where to find built files
  "buildCommand": "npm run build"   // ← This tells Vercel how to build
}
```

**Why this fixes it:**
- **Vite** (your build tool) outputs to `dist/` directory  
- **Create React App** would output to `build/` directory
- Vercel was looking for `build/` but you're using Vite
